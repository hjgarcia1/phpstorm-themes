# PHPStorm Color Schemes Collection

A collection of Color Schemes for PHPStorm. These are my take on some of the more popular ones.

All themes should support the following languages:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. PHP
4. Javascript
5. LESS
6. SCSS/SASS
7. SQL
8. JSON
9. XML
10. YAML

##Installation:

To install copy the "icls" file to one of the following locations depending on your setup:

### On a Windows
c:/Users/USERNAME/your-version-of-phpstorm/config/colors


### On MacOS
~/Library/Preferences/your-version-of-phpstorm/colors/

### On a Linux
~/your-version-of-phpstorm/config/colors

Then Restart PHPStorm

Enjoy!
